Answer to the question depends on the following sub-questions:\n\n1. Demand side Which neighborhood has the most demands on Chinese cuisine?\n2. Supply side Which neighborhood so far has the mildest competition regarding Chinese food?\n3. Market side The infrasturcure, supply chain, consumer preferences, transportation, neighborhood security, etc.\n\nLets dive deeper for further analyses, one by one",

Here are some candidate factors to take into consideration\n\n- Domestic inhabitants\n- Ethnic composition. It is safe to suppose that Asian decendents prefer Asian foods including Chinese cuisine\n- Other structural factors such as age, gender, occupation, income, and so on\n\nDue to data availability issues, in this assignment we only use the domestic inhabitants as a proxy to reflect domestic demand\n\n**External demand** referes to demands on Chinese food from those who come to this area for a short-period, for the purporses like tour, business trip, friend-visiting, and so on\n\n- In this assignment, wee do not pay much attention to the external demand. The main reason is fixed effects: the neighborhoods we compare all locate in Toronto, a nice city attracting tourists from all over the world. It is safe to assume that tourists who come to Toronto may go everywhere and eat everywhere around the whole city. In that sense, neighborhoods do not differ much from each other",

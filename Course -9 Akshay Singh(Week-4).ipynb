I decided to apply my acquired knowledge into the field of Data Classification and implement it on the data available in Spotify platform.\n\n**Business problem**\n\n- Understand the user's needs and preferences in evaluating musical tracks.\n- Knowing these characteristics, provide better services.\n\n**Target audience**\n\n- Audio streaming providers.\n- Any person willing to get insights about using classification modeling in solving machine learning problems.\n\n**Main goals**\n\n- Determine characteristics that define the user's musical taste.\n- Using these characteristics compare the music user likes or dislikes.\n- Create a predictive model on whether user likes or dislikes a song.\n- Determine the main musical genres that are in user\u2019s preferences.",

            "source": "The data set is constructed from the Spotify playlists that I have created for myself. There are 80 playlists in total - 45 liked, 25 disliked and 10 for evaluation. Liked playlists are labeled as 'GOOD' and disliked as 'BAD'. For later evaluation purposes a separate file is for ten different musical genres and the algorithm I have written scans my playlists and creates a data set where each genre has its own appropriate random track and audio features.\n\nTo get the info of playlists tracks and the audio features of them, I used the Spotipy API. The data used for modeling is described by the following ten audio features:\n\n- **Acousticness**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.\n- **Energy**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.\n- **Danceability**: Describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\n- **Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content.\n- **Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live.\n- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track. Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\n- **Speechiness**: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talkshow, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.\n- **Tempo**: The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n- **Valence**: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).\n- **Duration**: The duration of the track in milliseconds.",
